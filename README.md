# Hannah Sheridan - Open-Ended Project
This program is a Wheel of Fortune game with two players. It has a WheelOfFortune class that holds functions of the game and validates almost all user input. The WheelOfFortune class "Has-A" Player and a Wheel. The component Player class holds fields and methods specific to each player, like balance and name. The Wheel class fills the wheel with different prizes and can spin the wheel. The players are given a puzzle taken randomly from a file and are prompted to guess consonants and vowels. For every letter guessed, that letter will be printed to the console. Whichever player solves the puzzle wins the game! 

### Module 2 Concepts Used:
* Component Class Relationship
* File Input

### Known Bugs:
* Game still prompts user to guess a consonant even if all possible consonants have been guessed
* Puzzle board does not print centered in the console

### Future Expansions:
* Add a set of game rules for the user
* Improve visual aspects of the game
* Add a class to represent the puzzle board

### Expected grade: 75
I believe my program is sufficiently complex for an Open-Ended Project, and all input is validated correctly. I used one of the C++ concepts, so I expect to get points for only that concept. My program is organized and has comments, and I began creating it a week before the due date. However, I do believe there are many improvements to be made and more concepts that can be added to my program.
