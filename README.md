# Hannah Sheridan - Open-Ended Project
This program is a Wheel of Fortune game with one player. It has a WheelOfFortune class that holds functions of the game and validates almost all user input. Main represents the current user who is playing, storing variables like the user's balance and the current prize. The user is given a puzzle taken randomly from a file and is prompted to guess consonants and vowels. For every letter guessed, that letter will be printed to the console. The user can solve the puzzle or end the game at any time. 

### Module 1 Concepts Used:
* C++ Class

### Known Bugs:
* Player can still guess a vowel after all vowels have been guessed
* Program does not print entire puzzle after it has been solved

### Future Expansions:
* Add a set of game rules for the user
* Improve visual aspects of the game
* Add an option for a second user

### Expected grade: 40-50
I believe my program is sufficiently complex for an Open-Ended Project, and all input is validated correctly. I used one of the C++ concepts, so I expect to get points for only that concept. My program is organized and has comments, and I began creating it a week before the due date. However, I do believe there are many improvements to be made and more concepts that can be added to my program.
